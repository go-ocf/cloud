# Scalable OCF Cloud Hosting / Testing
Being [plugged.in](https://pluggedin.cloud) provides you a complete set of tools and services to manage your devices at scale. Allowing for the processing of real-time device data and interconnection of your devices and applications based on an interoperable standard. Interconnect, monitor and manage your devices in a cloud native way.

# OCF Cloud Bundle
Provides a simple docker cloud image for **testing purpose**.

- [OCF Native Cloud](https://openconnectivity.org/specs/OCF_Device_To_Cloud_Services_Specification_v2.1.0.pdf)
- OAUTH Athorization code is not verified
- [GRPC](https://github.com/go-ocf/cloud/blob/master/grpc-gateway/pb/service.proto)

## Supported clients
- [iotivity v2+](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity)
- [iotivity-lite v2+](https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity-lite)


## Pull the image
```bash
docker pull ocfcloud/cloud:vnext
```

## Configuration
Image can be configured via enviroment variables as argument `-e ENV=VALUE` of command `docker`:

| `LOGS_PATH` | string | path to directory | `"/data/log"` |

## Run
```bash
docker run -d --network=host --name=cloud -t ocfcloud/cloud:vnext
```

## Device Onboarding
The onboarding values which should be set to the [coapcloudconf](https://github.com/openconnectivityfoundation/cloud-services/blob/c2c/swagger2.0/oic.r.coapcloudconf.swagger.json) device resource are:

### Unsecured device
| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ------|
| `apn` | `test` |
| `cis` | `coap+tcp://127.0.0.1:5683` |
| `sid` | `same as is set in COAP_GATEWAY_CLOUD_ID` |
| `at` | `test` |

### Secured device
| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ------|
| `apn` | `test`|
| `cis` | `coaps+tcp://127.0.0.1:5684` |
| `sid` | `same as is set in COAP_GATEWAY_CLOUD_ID` |
| `at` | `test` |

#### Conditions:
- Device must be owned.
- Cloud CA must be set as TRUST CA with subject COAP_GATEWAY_CLOUD_ID in device.
- Cloud CA in PEM:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it cloud cat CERITIFICATES_PATH/root_ca.crt
  ```
- ACL for Cloud (Subject: COAP_GATEWAY_CLOUD_ID) must be set with full access to all published resources in device.

## Build a sample device application
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-ocf/grpc-gateway/master/device-simulator/patches/devsim.diff -o devsim.diff
git clone https://github.com/iotivity/iotivity-lite.git
cd ./iotivity-lite/port/linux
patch -p1 < ../devsim.diff
make
make clean
make CLOUD=1 SECURE=0 cloud_server
./cloud_server "Test Device" coap+tcp://127.0.0.1:5683 test test
```

## Build a COAP client application
To build the client you need to have **golang v1.13+**.
```bash
cd ./client/coap
go build
./coap --help
# gets a resource links of the registered devices from cloud
./coap --signUp test --href /oic/res
```

## Build a GRPC client application
To build the client you need to have **golang v1.13+**.
```bash
cd ./client/grpc
go build
./grpc --help
# gets all resources with contents from cloud
./grpc
# gets resources of device with contents from cloud
./grpc --deviceid {deviceID}
# gets devices from cloud
./grpc --getdevices
```
